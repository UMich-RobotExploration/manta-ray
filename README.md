Environment-aware robotics simulation that leverages bellhopcuda to propogate acoustic ranging.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently an in-work repository supporting @tko-devs's master thesis. It is not in a state ready for usage.

# mantaray (C++)
To see the documentation webpage and details of the C++ component of this simulation, visit [C++ README](./mantaray/README.md)

# pymantaray (python)
Currently this is not a package, but a set of helper scripts to generate files for input to (C++). The maturity is far lesser than the C++ code.
